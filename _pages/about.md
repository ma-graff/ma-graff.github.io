Hi, I'm Matt - I'm a 3rd year Geography & Computer Science (Geomatics) student at the University of Victoria.

[Check out my projects](/projects) and my [experience](/resume), I'm mostly interested in geospatial data, visualizing data, and UX/UI design.

Currently, I'm looking for a co-op for Fall 2025. If you want to get in touch, please use the links below.
