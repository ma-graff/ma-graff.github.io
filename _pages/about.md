Hi, I'm Matt - I'm a Geography & Computer Science (Geomatics) student at UVic.

[Check out my projects](/projects) and my [experience](/resume), I'm mostly interested in geospatial, data analysis, and UX/UI design.

Currently, I'm looking for a co-op position for fall 2025. If you want to get in touch, please use the links below.
