Hi, I'm Matt - I'm a Geography & Computer Science (Geomatics) student at UVic.

**[Check out my projects](/projects)** and my **[experience](/resume)**.

I do geospatial, data science/visualization, software development and design. My biggest strength is **Python**.

Currently, I'm open for a co-op position for **Fall 2025**.
