Hi, I'm Matt - I'm a Computer Science & Geography student at UVic.

**[Check out my projects](/projects)** and my **[experience](/resume)**.

My skills are in geospatial, data science, software development and design. My biggest strengths are **Python**, SQL and Geospatial Data.

Currently, I'm open for a co-op position for **Fall 2025**, either remotely or in Montréal.
