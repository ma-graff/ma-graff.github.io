Hi, I'm Matt - I'm a 3rd year Geography & Computer Science (Geomatics) student at the University of Victoria.

I'm interested in visalizing all types of data, especially geographic data. I'm also interested in UI/UX design, remote sensing, and software development. I have professional experience in Python, AWS, SQL, and ArcGIS at GeoBC and Avenue Road Properties. I hope to gain more experience through personal projects in Tableau, D3, Figma, and more.

Currently, I'm attending my second-to-last semester at UVic. If you want to get in touch, please use the links below.
