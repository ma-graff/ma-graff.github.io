Hi, I'm Matt - I'm a Geography & Computer Science (Geomatics) student at UVic.

**[Check out my projects](/projects)** and my **[experience](/resume)**.

I do geospatial, data science/visualization, software development and some design. My biggest strength is **Python**.

Currently, I'm open for a co-op position for fall 2025. If you want to get in touch, please use the links below.
