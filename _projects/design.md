In SENG 321 (Requirements Engineering), I collaborated with a team to design and prototype a system for monitoring power usage in remote Canadian power grids. Working closely with an industry mentor and with other groups in a client-designer relationship, we gathered requirements, ensured alignment with stakeholder needs, and I developed a **functional prototype in Figma** to address real-world challenges in remote energy management. We then presented our prototype to real investors and industry experts.
