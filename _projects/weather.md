### Overview
At **Avenue Road**, I was responsible for aggregating and analyzing **historical and forecast weather data** using **Python** and **SQLite**. My work involved automating **API calls** and utilizing **Selenium for web scraping** to collect weather data, structuring it in a database, and generating **weekly reports** with detailed **weather and snow forecasts**. These reports played a key role in **data-driven decision-making** for clients.  

### Key Responsibilities

- Automated Data Collection 
  - Integrated multiple **weather APIs** to fetch **historical and forecast data**.  
  - **Utilized Selenium** to scrape weather-related data from websites when APIs lacked specific information.  
  - Scheduled automated API calls and web scraping tasks using **Python scripts**, ensuring up-to-date data.  
  - Processed, cleaned, and stored data in an **SQLite database** for structured analysis.  

- Database Management & Analysis
  - Maintained a database of **thousands of weather records**, ensuring **consistency and reliability**.  
  - Designed optimized **SQL queries** for efficient data retrieval and analysis.  
  - Used **Pandas and NumPy** to process weather data, identify trends, and generate insights.  

- Forecast Reporting & Insights
  - Produced **8 detailed weather forecasts per month**, including **snow accumulation, temperature trends, and precipitation probabilities**.  
  - Delivered **data-driven reports** that supported **client planning and operational decisions**.  
  - Used **Matplotlib and Seaborn** to visualize weather trends, making forecasts more actionable.  

### Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Data collection, processing, and automation.  
- **Selenium** – Web scraping for weather data extraction.  
- **APIs** – Automated retrieval of forecast and historical weather data.  
- **SQLite** – Structured storage of weather records.  
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data manipulation and statistical analysis.  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization for trend analysis.  
- **Scheduling (e.g., Cron Jobs, Task Scheduler)** – Automating data retrieval and report generation.  

### Impact & Achievements
✅ Enabled **data-driven decision-making** for clients through **accurate and timely weather forecasts**.  
✅ Maintained a **reliable weather database** with thousands of records for continuous analysis.  
✅ Automated **API calls and web scraping**, reducing manual effort and improving **data collection efficiency**.  

This project strengthened my expertise in **data engineering, web scraping, API integration, and predictive analysis**, providing **valuable insights for weather-dependent decision-making**.
