Lately, I’ve been working on a simple iOS task management app using Swift and SwiftUI. The goal is to build something lightweight yet structured—focused more on helping me prioritize and organize tasks rather than overwhelming me with features.

The core idea is to strip away distractions and let the app revolve around just three principles: what I need to do, how important it is, and when I should tackle it. I’m using a combination of priority flags, deadline tracking, and a “Today View” that encourages a realistic daily focus.

I've also read a lot about the SLC framework (https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/), and want to start using it in everything I make.
